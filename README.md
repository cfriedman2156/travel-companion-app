# TRVLR

Welcome to TRVLR, a travel companion app where you can input your departure country, your destination country, and your budget. It also gives you a fun fact in your destination's capital city as well as that nation's flag. We hope it helps you with planning your next getaway adventure.


## Description

With the first phase of this three month bootcamp soon to be in our rearview window, we decided that we're already looking forward to the vacation(s) we'll be taking once this is over and done with. To that end, we designed TRVLR, a web app that helps those traveling abroad by converting your budget into the currency of your desired destination. We wanted to make sure you could be anywhere in the world going anywhere in the world and get the most accurate information as per the APIs we enlisted in this app. TRVLR solves this problem by giving you a sleek and easy to understand interface that displays calculations cleanly and clearly. Whether you're planning a long term vacation or doing a last minute excursion on a whim and a dime, this app was made to help you know how much money you are taking with the currency of the country you're going to!

## Installation
